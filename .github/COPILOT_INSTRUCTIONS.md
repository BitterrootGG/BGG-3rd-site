# 🔒 BITTERROOT GROUND & GRAVEL
## COPILOT MASTER INSTRUCTION GUIDE
### FINAL – ENFORCED – NON-NEGOTIABLE

This repository is a production-bound website for a real heavy-equipment business.

If any Copilot suggestion, refactor, optimization, or rewrite conflicts with this document:
THIS DOCUMENT WINS.

Copilot must follow these rules exactly.

---

## 1. PROJECT PURPOSE

This project is a **business-facing website** for:

**Bitterroot Ground & Gravel**
Heavy equipment, land management, forestry, site access, and material services in Western Montana.

This is NOT:
- a developer portfolio
- a resume site
- a tech demo
- a game
- an animation playground

This IS:
- a professional service business website
- with a restrained 3D hero
- designed to qualify leads, protect equipment, and enforce scope reality

---

## 2. CORE BUSINESS REALITY (LOCKED)

The following facts are true and may not be altered or contradicted:

- Equipment class: 100–120 HP compact track loader (Cat 275XE class)
- Operating region: Western Montana
- Location cost factor: +10%
- True internal all-in operating cost ≈ $125/hour (INTERNAL ONLY)
- CTL-intensive work is priced using **daily rates**
- Hourly CTL pricing is allowed only for mixed-use access work
- Internal costs, margins, burn rates, and formulas are NEVER exposed publicly

Copilot must never surface or explain internal pricing math.

---

## 3. SCOPE OF ALLOWED CHANGES

Copilot MAY:
- Replace portfolio content with business content
- Remove developer-focused sections (skills, resume, projects, extracurriculars)
- Reorder sections to match a real customer journey
- Update copy to match CONTENT_BGG.md
- Adjust layout and styling within existing frameworks

Copilot MAY NOT:
- Add new dependencies
- Remove Three.js / react-three-fiber
- Rewrite or refactor 3D canvas code unless explicitly instructed
- Introduce backend services
- Invent pricing, discounts, or guarantees
- Override safety, slope, or minimum rules
- Touch ad tracking logic unless explicitly instructed

---

## 4. 3D HERO RULES

- 3D is limited to the hero section
- Motion must be subtle and non-disorienting
- No spinning, flying, looping, or novelty effects
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Optimize for mobile and rural connections
- Do not autoplay audio

3D exists to reinforce professionalism, not impress other developers.

---

## 5. REQUIRED PAGE STRUCTURE

The site must follow this order:

1. Hero
2. Services
3. Process
4. Service Area
5. Quote / Contact

Navigation and layout must reflect how a landowner actually evaluates a contractor.

---

## 6. SAFETY & SLOPE LIMITS (HARD GATES)

- ≤ 18° slope → mechanized CTL work allowed
- > 18° slope → mechanized mulching prohibited

If slope > 18°:
- Switch to manual / alternate methods
- Force $3,000/day minimum internally
- Hand work included
- No hourly hand labor billing
- Additional labor only if required

These limits are NEVER overridden.

---

## 7. SEASONAL PRICING (INTERNAL LOGIC ONLY)

Seasons (Western Montana):
- Winter (Dec 1 – Mar 15): 1.10×
- Mud / Shoulder (Mar 16 – May 31): 1.25×
- Peak / Dry (Jun 1 – Sep 30): 1.00×
- Late Season (Oct 1 – Nov 30): 1.10×

Customer-facing language (only when applied):
“Pricing reflects seasonal ground conditions, access limitations, and equipment risk typical for this time of year.”

---

## 8. PERMITS (MANDATORY LANGUAGE)

Permit requirements vary by jurisdiction.
Property owners are responsible for obtaining all required permits.
Quotes may be provided without permits.
Work cannot be scheduled or performed until permits are obtained.

Verbatim language to use:
“To determine permit requirements, property owners should contact their local county planning department, road department, or city building office for the jurisdiction where the property is located.”

Copilot must NEVER imply BGG secures permits.

---

## 9. OUTPUT STYLE RULES

- Plain English
- Firm, professional tone
- No hype
- No invented discounts
- No safety overrides
- No legal advice
- No permit promises

---

## FINAL LOCK STATEMENT

This system:
- Prices reality, not hope
- Protects equipment and margins
- Filters bad work automatically
- Adapts to Montana seasons without drama

Copilot must comply fully.
